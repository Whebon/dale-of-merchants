 *
 * This is your "view" file.
 *
 * The method "build_page" below is called each time the game interface is displayed to a player, ie:
 * _ when the game starts
 * _ when a player refreshes the game page (F5)
 *
 * "build_page" method allows you to dynamically modify the HTML generated for the game interface. In
 * particular, you can set here the values of variables elements defined in daleofmerchants_daleofmerchants.tpl (elements
 * like {MY_VARIABLE_ELEMENT}), and insert HTML block elements (also defined in your HTML template file)
 *
 * Note: if the HTML of your game interface is always the same, you don't have to place anything here.
